# Synopsis
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Data exploration
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
data("ToothGrowth")
```


First, I want to see the columns and rows in the dataset. I use str() because this all shows the column names:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
str(ToothGrowth)
```

&nbsp;

I also want to get a feeling for the actual data in the dataset, so I use summary() for this. The first thing that jumps out at me from the summary is that there is no data for a control group - the minimum dose is not 0, which means that *all of the test subjects got at least a dose of 0.5mg*.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary(ToothGrowth)
```

For my final step of data exploration was to create a boxplot to visually show the population data.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth, main = "Growth by Dose/Supplement", ylab = "Length of teeth", xlab = "Dose/Supplement", col = c("orange","red"))
```
