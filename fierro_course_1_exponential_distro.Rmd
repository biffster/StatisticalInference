The

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1024)
lambda_class_1 <- .2
initdata <- replicate(1000,rexp(40,lambda_class_1))
initMeanData <- replicate(1000,{mean(rexp(40,lambda_class_1))})
```
By its definition, an exponential distribution is **not** a normal distribution, and as such, it does not make a gaussian histogram. Instead, it is weighted, going from the highest values at 0 and flattening out to tail along the X axis, as shown with the histogram of our sample:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(initdata)
```

However, one would expect a population of mean values to follow a normal distribution, and the histogram below shows that is exactly what happens:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
hist(initMeanData)
mean(initMeanData)
```
